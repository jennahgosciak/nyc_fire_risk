# Exploratory analysis to create a predictive model about fire risk in NYC
* Will use the following datasets:
  - HPD vacate orders due to fire
  - Census data on median household income, percent of households renting, population density per unit, race and ethnicity
  - For larger buildings, an estimate of 'doubling-up' based on water usage
  - Number of class C (severe) HPD violations
